# Vidars
The silent guardian. A behavioral anomaly detection system for Linux, written in Rust

> *"In Norse myth, Víðarr is the god of vengeance and survival. He remains silent, observes, and strikes only when the wolf's jaws are at the throat of the world. He survives the end."*

##Philosophy
- **Silence:** No noisy alerts. Only meaningful deviations.
- **Vision:** Sees what others miss.
- **Rust:** Memory-safe, fast, and built for reliability.

##Status: **Nothing...**
The core architecture is being designed. Not yet functional.
